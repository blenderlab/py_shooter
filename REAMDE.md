=== Py_Shooter ===

A python coding basis to implement  AI or algorithms. 

The game have 2 modes : 

 * AUTO : the algorithm (chooseNextMove) choose best place to go.
 * AI : the model is loaded to find next move.

the data is made of 7 entries (X+Y) :
posX, leftennemies, centerennemies, rightennemies, moveleft (1/0) ,stay(1/0), moveright(1/0)

the trainmodel.py creates a keras model, train against the data collected, and saves it, so that you can now play in AI mode.
